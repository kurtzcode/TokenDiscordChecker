# TokenDiscordChecker
Token Checker is the ideal tool to check the validity of Discord tokens. It allows you to quickly check whether a token is valid or not. At a glance, you can see if the token is good or bad, if it’s associated with an email or phone number, if it has Nitro benefits, and even view the associated username. 🔍
